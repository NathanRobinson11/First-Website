				<div class="experience-title">Manager</div>
				<div class="experience-description">My duties as manager were to ensure the running of the day to day operations through planning and allocating tasks to staff. My focus from the outset was to increase efficiency and productivity by improving the floor layout and reducing time waste through unneccessary movement of people and parts. I was able to increase revenue by 25% in my first 6 months and profits by 35% during the same period. The business had 8 full-time staff and 4 part-time and I was also responsible for advertising, recruitment, sourcing new business, precurment and customer service. My biggest achievement was landing a deal with DHL for £250,000 per year and helped move the business towards steady contract work and away from seasonal daytrade</div>

				<div class="experience-description">Working in a fast paced food production environment I ran a team of 4 people responsible for meeting daily and weekly targets. Our objectives were to temper food for customers such as Iceland and Morrisons from frozen to ambient temperatures within a strict timescale. Working to these deadlines meant flexibilty regarding hours as the high quantity meant any delays had to be resolved immediately. I was responsible for communicating with other team-leads and our operations manager on a daily basis to discuss plans and scheduling tasks to ensure the operation ran as best it could. </div>
